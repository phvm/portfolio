    <InnerText>
      My favorite work is to build software that looks great, is accessible to everyone and is blazing fast,
      meticulously crafting with accessibility, responsiveness and performance in mind.

      Outside of coding and building software, my other hobbies include playing video games and cooking. I'm a
      experimentalist by nature. I feel trilled to try new things, be it a new technology, a new flavor of my favorite
      drink or a new way to cook my favorite dish.
